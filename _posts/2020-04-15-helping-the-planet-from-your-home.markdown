Today, there is an evident increase of many infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, hantavirus, hepatitis C and SARS. But is there any relation between diseases and climate change? According to the World Health Organization, the combined impacts of rapid demographic, environmental, social, technological and other changes in our way of living, have a consequence on the infectious disease occurrence.

The COVID-19 pandemic is the most recent infectious disease that became one of the greatest challenges for all of humanity. In fact, the last quarantine was in 1918 because of the Spanish flu. For almost a hundred years, humanity has not experienced a quarantine.

## Two sides of the situation
Quarantine certainly helps to decrease pollution in many places. For example, over large parts of China there is a reduction in surface particulate matter of around 20–30 percent, Venice’s canal water looks clearer, and in other parts animals’ species are returning to their natural areas. But there is a negative aspect emerging with this crisis.

The first days of the COVID-19 pandemic, people started to feel frightened and excessively bought food and other articles in the supermarket. This type of consumerist actions have a significant impact on the solid waste production, especially in countries that have no correct management of it. Also, water consumption increases because in many countries the quarantine, when the whole family is at home, concurs with summer, the peak season of water use.

## #AyudandoALaTierraDesdeCasa

We can help the planet through a number of actions from our homes. From our Central America volunteer group, Water Youth Network, we are boosting a virtual campaign called “Helping the planet from your home”. It consists of promoting many activities related to water and energy saving, household solid waste management and wildlife appreciation from home.

For water saving we recommend to first calculate your water footprint on the internet.
This may give you an idea of the impact of your consumption and this way you can identify in which activity you are wasting more water. According to this, you should applicate these simple steps to reduce your water consumption:

1. Turn off the tap when you clean your teeth. A running tap uses up to nine liters of water a minute.

2. In summer, it´s common to use a pool. You can water your ground or clean with this pool water. To water the plants, it´s preferable to use a watering can instead of a hosepipe.

3. Take a shorter shower. If possible, try to get a shower based on the timing of two songs. It’s not impossible.

4. Use a bowl in the sink when doing the dishes or washing fruit and vegetables. Then, you can use the waste water to water your plants.

5. Fix dripping taps. If you don’t, it can waste almost 15 liters of water each day.

Saving energy is another way to help the earth in these crucial times. There are some tips to do that:

1. Calculate your ecological footprint. That will make you more conscious of your energy consumption and its impact on the earth.

2. When possible, use natural light. Look for illuminated places to work.

3. Change your light bulbs to LEDs.

4. Don’t leave your computer switched on all day long. Only turn it on when you need it.

5. Don’t leave your mobile phone plugged in overnight.

To protect not only the environment, but also health security and population health, it is necessary to execute the actions previously described with a correct household solid waste management. One of the most important tips is the separation of the waste in different containers classified in recyclable (plastic, paper, cardboard, glass, metal, clothing and fabrics) and organic waste (biodegradable).

Looking for other uses of the recyclables can be a good option. For example, many people make flower pots and vases using plastic bottles, or handcraft using other material as metal, glass or paper. This can also be a type of family therapy, because it improves creativity and increases mental health. Another option is collecting all the recyclable material and contacting the authorized managers in your region. At least, organic waste can be used to make compost for the garden but if you don´t have one, you can dispose the differentiated containers by giving it to trash truck.

To finish this list of tips, we believe that appreciating the nature around (but from inside) our home can be another relevant activity, because it gets us to know the species in the city and their importance for the ecological balance. A good exercise can be identifying the flora and fauna that can be found in our garden. There are many applications of citizen science (public participation and collaboration in scientific research to increase scientific knowledge) like “I naturalist”. In this application, you can take a picture with your cell phone and upload it to the platform, and if you don´t know which animal or plant you’ve seen, other users may help you. This type of break from your regular home activities, can benefit both your mental and physical wellbeing too.

## An opportunity to change

I read on the World Economic Forum a quote that said “The COVID-19 pandemic is a stark reminder of our dysfunctional relationship with nature”. In the end, this is true.

> **The COVID-19 pandemic is a stark reminder of our dysfunctional relationship with nature.**

This coronavirus crisis is not inherent of the planet health, and the decisions made on how to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic will determine the future health, welfare and stability of people and the planet.

Remember all that we only have ten years remaining to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and this pandemic shows us that a different socioeconomic system is vulnerable to shocks.

Let us take this situation as the opportunity to change our lifestyle and reestablish our connection with nature.

We encourage the youth to use social media to promote this type of actions for helping the planet, to stay informed and to always search other alternatives for developing a sustainable consumption.

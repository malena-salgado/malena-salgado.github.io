I’m writing this article on the thirty-seventh day of the self-imposed quarantine by the Nicaraguan population, after the official announcement by the government of the first coronavirus case in the country, and forty-four days after this disease was declared a pandemic by the WHO.

I would like to emphasize that this is a compilation of the country’s situation from my point of view, a young Nicaraguan from the capital, and that I have resorted to secondary information sources to substantiate my opinions.

## The arrival of the coronavirus in Nicaragua

Since the news about the outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus originating in China, we on the western side of the world have considered the possibility of its arrival on our continent to be remote, and Nicaragua was no exception. However, the first case seen in the Americas took no more than a month to become known. It quickly became apparent that the cases were spreading throughout the continent, until in Central America only El Salvador and Nicaragua had no reports.

It was on March 18 of this year that both countries released their first reported cases, but only El Salvador had begun to implement measures earlier. The uncertainty in Nicaraguans had begun weeks before the first case was known, but following this announcement many institutions, businesses and workplaces decided to suspend face-to-face activities immediately.

## The government’s response

The official announcement of the first case was made by the vice president and first lady, Rosario Murillo, through her media. The announcement emphasized that this was an imported case and that there was no local contagion in Nicaragua; this discourse has been maintained to the date of creation of this article.

In the following days, an official communication of President Daniel Ortega was expected, but this didn’t happen until April 15th. However, the official response from the authorities, again through vice president Murillo, was to call for a march called “Love in Times of COVID-19”, which was not in line with the recommendations of the World Health Organization and was [criticized worldwide](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/04/10/nicaragua-reckless-covid-19-response).

On the official website of the Ministry of Health, a communiqué was published entitled “Measures against the coronavirus”, which stated that “Nicaragua has not established and will not establish any type of quarantine”; and that “People coming from countries with risk of transmission established by the WHO and without symptoms will not have any restriction on their mobility and movement in the country”.

Similarly, the health authorities have not yet presented the estimates of the COVID-19 projections, nor the equipment of the country’s hospitals that are intended to treat the cases.

In the absence of decisive action, Monsignor Rolando Alvarez, one of the bishops of the Nicaraguan Episcopal Conference, asked the government for permission to begin a prevention plan that would include six service stations in the country and an information hotline. That request was rejected.

The government’s initiative was to establish [health brigades](https://www.el19digital.com/articulos/ver/titulo:102570-continua-visita-a-hogares-sobre-medidas-preventivas-ante-el-covid-19-en-managua) to visit every house in order to inform the Nicaraguan population about preventive measures against the pandemic. Again, without following WHO recommendations, since health workers are not provided with the protective requirements (masks and gloves), nor do they comply with social distancing measures.

The Government has also set up a National Information Centre through the Ministry of Health, where the population can contact a team that will provide care and information on line 132. During the writing of this article I called the line asking about projections of coronavirus infections for Nicaragua, to which they replied that they only have the current data and that they are confident that they will not have more. For my safety, I had to change my details at the time of this call.

## Progress of cases
The Ministry of Health has reported 11 confirmed cases; of which 7 have recovered, 1 is in hospital and 3 have died. But the population’s distrust of these data is due to the fact that in the region, we are the only country with few reported cases and no prevention measures, which contrasts with the reality of other countries that do have closed borders and that internally are following the recommendations of WHO and PAHO (Pan American Health Organisation).

In addition, the country’s health authorities provide their reports in a confusing manner, not using medical technicalities. This makes it more difficult for citizens to be informed about the progress of the virus.

The projections are a tool that helps us visualize the key periods in which the curve can be lowered, but without official and real information this becomes uncertain. The Humboldt Center, a non-governmental organization, made its projections for Nicaragua and defined that at the peak of the curve there will be 11,516 cases, and only in October of this year the deactivation of the virus will begin. So far, it is one of the few projections available.

With the current cases, there is one that stands out because the patient stated to independent media that he contracted the virus locally since he works as a taxi driver. This disproves the health authorities’ claim that there is no community infection. Cuban authorities also report that three of their cases are from Nicaragua.
In recent days, there has been an atypical increase in cases and deaths from pneumonia in the country, according to the Ministry of Health’s official website. What is relevant about this is that cases of pneumonia are more common in the rainy season, and currently in Nicaragua we are in the dry season. As of 28 March, this year, there were 22,713 cases and 66 deaths.

## Economy and environment will also be affected
The country’s economy suffered a considerable blow with the still latent socio-political crisis of 2018, so this health crisis will further complicate the picture. One of the sectors most affected is trade and tourism. In the country’s main shopping centers, more than 50% of shops are closed and there is little influx of shoppers, due to the self-imposed quarantine by the citizens.

But in an economy as vulnerable as ours, maintaining this quarantine for a long time would be very difficult. And there is still a large sector of the population that continues with their daily tasks and uses public transport on a daily basis, in addition to the informal workers who survive on their daily earnings.

As an environmental engineer, I think it is also worth remembering that the spread of infectious vectors is closely related to climate change and Nicaragua is among the countries most affected by it. The Humboldt Center emphasizes that the pandemic will pronounce the environmental crisis that the country and the region are experiencing, because more natural assets will be needed to recover the devastated economies.

In this regard, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources has not promoted any information campaign on the pandemic or its relationship to climate change. For their part, they are promoting [media activities](https://www.el19digital.com/articulos/ver/titulo:102123-marena-promueve-el-cuido-de-la-madre-tierra-con-concurso-de-trajes-elaborados-con-material-reciclado) that also disregard the social distancing advice to be adopted.

## What does the future hold for us Nicaraguans?

Disinformation and paranoia reign in our country’s social networks because of the lack of transparency from our authorities. As citizens, we are taking all the measures within our reach, but this will not be effective if the current situation of the pandemic in our country is not known.

The specialists on the subject, who are being the critical voices, are censured and removed from their job posts, resulting in fewer trained personnel to deal with this crisis. We do not know when we will be able to overcome the consequences of the coronavirus, while the political situation in our country does not indicate any progress for next year, when the presidential elections are to be held.

As citizens, it is important to acknowledge the situation we are experiencing, always remembering that reliable sources of information will help us to improve the dynamics of communication. And from our homes we must abide by the actions of global health organizations.

And to conclude, I would like to remind you that our commitment also should go to the rational and efficient use of resources such as water, energy, food and medicine, since solidarity and conscience will help to make this situation more resilient.
